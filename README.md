## Resources used:
1. I used a lot of online resources
2. Had tutoring session for intial setup 
3. Got help from Chapgpt, Stackoverflow, Previous classes, youtube.

## Learning points: Learned a lot !! from this challenge. Faced infinite errors and tired to solve most of them but got stuck real bad at some points especially around connect the files and how they communicate with imports and routes and middleware.

## I was not able to get my routes correct I struggled a lot with it therefore my app is not giving data.
